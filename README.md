# FaceGAN
The idea is to in-paint the missing part of the face and address the peculiarities of face using textual description. We intend to achieve the results by applying pixel generation using GAN (Stage 1) combined with text to image conversion using GAN (Stage 2) benchmarking on a custom-made dataset for  this task.
